      <p>Our goal is to have fun and get the studio feeling back into our lives during the WFH temporary situation. Having said that, please act around this virtual studio just as you would do when in the real office.

      <p>If you&apos;re being harassed, notice someone being harassed, or have any other concerns related to the code of conduct, you have a few options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Point out the mistake to the offender directly as they might not have bad intentions. You can use <code>/whisper</code> into the chat box, followed by a message, to contact them directly or our Netcentric tools like Slack.</li>
        <li>Reach out to the respective PSL.</li>
