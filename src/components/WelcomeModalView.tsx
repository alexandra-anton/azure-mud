      <p>You can move from virtual room to virtual room to talk to different people, explore and interact with your surroundings.</p>
      <p>Our hope is to facilitate group conversations, to make this Christmas story feel a little more like a real-world interaction, and to give you a fun and playful space to explore with your fellow studio mates.</p>
      <p>Happy wandering, and be wary of reading scrolls without identifying them first ðŸ˜‰</p>
