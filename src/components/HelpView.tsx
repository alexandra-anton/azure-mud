      <p>Welcome to the Netcentric virtual studio <span role="img" aria-label="tada">ðŸŽ‰</span> </p>
      <p>Many of us wondered when we will be able to return to the office. We did some redecoration in the meantime and now it's ready again.</p>
      <p>You can sip a coffee at the reception, take the elevator to a cigarette break, talk to other colleagues, explore unknown corners and interact with your surroundings.</p>
      <p>Talk to each other off Slack and make this Christmas celebration feel a little more like a real-world interaction. </p>
      <p>Happy wandering, and be wary of reading scrolls without identifying them first <span role="img" aria-label="wink">ðŸ˜‰</span></p><p></p>
