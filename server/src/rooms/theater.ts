  You enter the Ateneu room. There\â€™s purple tinsel and stockings hanging from the wall. Also the tables and chairs were replaced with some really soft-looking couches and bean bags. Somebody also appears to have installed a real fireplace here. It really has been a while since you have been to the office.
  <br/><br/>
  In one corner of the room, there is a purple paravane with golden stars on it. It\'s sitting next to a rack carrying what seems to be [[a pair of Christmassy pyjamas->item]]. Now you can cozy up and watch whatever is on the screen. Enjoy the slumber party!
