  You would have never guessed that this kind of room exists - but hey, here you are in the Nostalgia Dance Room when you notice a white guy with mad smile on his face and strange haircut coming over to you and saying "I'm gonna Ice you out!". As he snaps his fingers the tune is changing and you can loudly hear "Ice Ice baby!!" and you think - was that Vanilla ICE?!<br/><br/>

          <p><Music of the 00s</p>
          <p>In American culture, various styles of the late 20th century remained popular, such as in rock, pop, metal, hip hop, R&B, EDM, country and indie. As the technology of computers and internet sharing developed, a variety of those genres started to fuse in order to see new styles emerging. Terms like "contemporary", "nu", "revival", "alternative", and "post" are added to various genres titles in order to differentiate them from past styles, nu-disco and post-punk revival as notable examples.
