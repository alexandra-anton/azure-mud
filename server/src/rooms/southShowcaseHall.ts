  You arrive at the cork wall and look at all the <a href="google-photos.html" onClick="window.open(\'google-photos.html#\' + window.getComputedStyle(document.body).getPropertyValue(\'background-color\'), \'google-photos\', \'width=560,height=460\'); return false">pictures</a> of you and your colleagues at different events or simple snapshots of day-to-day office life. Some of them are corny, but still, they manage to spark in you a sense of joy towards the memories you have here and the ones that are yet to come.

  You can go towards the [[Reception->foyer]], pay a visit to the Sys Eng corner or join everybody else in the MM area.`,
